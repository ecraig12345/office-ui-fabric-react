Panels are modal UI overlays that provide contextual app information. They often request some kind of creation or management action from the user.

A panel usually renders an Overlay component in addition to the panel content. The overlay blocks interactions with the app view until dismissed either by selecting a close or completion action within the Panel, or clicking or tapping the overlay (when "light dismiss" mode is enabled).

### Examples of experiences that use Panels
