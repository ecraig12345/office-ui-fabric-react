Toggles represent a physical switch that allows users to turn things on or off. Use Toggles to present users with two mutually exclusive options (like on/off), where choosing an option results in an immediate action. Use a Toggle for binary operations that take effect right after the user flips the Toggle. For example, use a Toggle to turn services or hardware components on or off. In other words, if a physical switch would work for the action, a Toggle is probably the best control to use.
