### Choosing between Toggle and Checkbox

For some actions, either a Toggle or a Checkbox might work. To decide which control would work better, follow these tips:

- Use a Toggle for binary settings when changes become effective immediately after the user changes them.
- Use a Checkbox when the user has to perform extra steps for changes to be effective. For example, if the user must click a "Submit", "Next", "Ok" button to apply changes, use a Checkbox.
