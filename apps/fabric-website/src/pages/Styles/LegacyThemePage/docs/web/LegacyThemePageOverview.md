**A new, much more full-featured theme designer is now available at https://aka.ms/themedesigner. The legacy theme designer is temporarily still available for reference.**

---

This tool helps you easily create all the shades and slots for a custom theme. The theme can be used by Fabric React's styling
package--see the [documentation](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/tree/master/packages/styling).

As you modify one of the three base colors, the theme will update automatically based on predefined rules. You can modify each
individual slot below as well.
